IT WOULD SEEM THAT INDEX PAGE IS ACTUALLY JUMBOTRON. IS THIS SMART TO HAVE INDEX AS JUMBOTRON, ESP FOR SEO? -->
      
      <!--ok, so just realized, there's no about page, because it's included in first half of play BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I MADE A MISTAKE AND MADE 2 SEPARATE SECTIONS, SO I'LL GO WITH IT. ESP SINCE WHEN SOMEONE FIRST GOES ON SITE THEY'LL WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND HAVE SEP PLAY AREA. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO DESIGN AN ABOUT PAGE THAT'S SIMPLE AND HAS PICS AND ALSO ABOUT ME. PLUS IF WOULD LIKE TO BE ON MAILING LIST, PLUS INCLUDE SOCIA L MEDIA PAGE, BUT TECHNICALLY THAT SHOULD BE ON EVERY PAGE? -->

<!--why don't my own tarot pngs come up at all? Did I not properly save? -->

<!--I want button to float near cat hand when screen adjusts and make it magical looking and inviting to press OR "let's play in glowing script and slight ball of color around it, with a glow effect when hover over to get brighter-->

<!--Because I want button to just be over cat paw, no matter what screen size, I can only assume that if position properly with cat photo, and perhaps relative to parent, that it will go in proper place, when cat photo has proper fluid responsive class. BUT IS IT BEST TO POSITION IN JUMBO? SEEMS STUPID QUESTION, BUT I ALMOST WANT BUTTON TO FEEL LIKE MAGICALLY FLOATS AND MOVES WITH CAT AS ADJUST. And so if I did try outside of Jumbo, would have to be in a container that includes jumbotron, BUT WHAT ABOUT NAV, FOOTER? WOULD BUTTON BE AFFECTED BY WHERE GOES DEPENDING ON ENTIRE PAGE??? -->

<!--do i need a separate container, like when Sheldon would add JUM, etc?-->
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid"> <!--adding h-100, won't help me here. I need cat to be smaller in mobile. AND WHEN on large screen, button needs padding and placement to go over paw itself.--> <!--should i add text align left class here instead of in css. why both jumbotron & jumbotron fluid? should i delete one?-->
  <div class="container">
    <h1 class="display-4">Cat Chat Tarot</h1>
    <p class="lead">This is a modified jumbotron that occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent.</p>

    <!--testing out where to put button so properly floats near cat paw at all times--> <!--plus may add an image in button with circle lights-->
    <!--putting button within jumbo doesn't go near cat paw properly, and even if adjusted where goes, may be too fixed. PLUS I NEED TO WORK ON LOGO GOING IN PROPER PLACE, in relation to cat.-->
    
    <!--SHELDON...can I make a div called button and not affect bootstap button? I get mixed up with buttons that link to action or buttons that link to another page. Obviously read up more and play with. ALSO THE LIGHT RING PNG LOOKS DULL AND SNOOZVILLE. DO own glow effect. -->

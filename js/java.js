//below is code worked on from javatest workspace for random tarot card

/*$(document).ready(function() {
    alert("I am an alert box!");
});    USED THIS TO TEST JS  */

/*all of probs had with items not appearing when I saved (css color only showed while typing notes and would revert back to nothing and also not have js work was for 2 reasons: had clickMe instead of clickME and had a directory up on css link in head*/

    $('#ask').click(function(){
        $('#tarotframe').fadeIn(2000); /* i may change rate. still too fast. something wrong with main page layout, as before tarotframe was hidden and cards faded in, and when refreshed page, tarotframe would be empty again. 9/4 */

var images = [ /* 16 cards in total as of 9/5. Prefer to have more selection for guests. Don't care if random sometimes displays similar cards in a row. That would make me want to stay on longer to see which other cards there...if I liked what I saw and didn't feel duped */

/*for images below, don't want them muddying up cards. And seems like a pain in ass to get all of this on img, esp since some photos have asian or arabic names in print/script. SHOULD I JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL CARDS IMGS FROM PNGTREE.COM? */
/* img all 550W x 730H font used in pixler: Sitka Text */

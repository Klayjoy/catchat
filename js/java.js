//below is code worked on from javatest workspace for random tarot card

/*$(document).ready(function() {
    alert("I am an alert box!");
});    USED THIS TO TEST JS  */

/*all of probs had with items not appearing when I saved (css color only showed while typing notes and would revert back to nothing and also not have js work was for 2 reasons: had clickMe instead of clickME and had a directory up on css link in head*/

// cards come up fine, but if one clicks on image that slid down and new random card is up when click on 'think of question'. personally i like this so doesn't have to keep sliding down, BUT THEN MUST STATE HOW WORKS in wording on play.html. 

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#ask').click(function(){
        $('#image').fadeIn(3000);
        $('#tarotframe').slideDown(3000);
  });
});  

var images = [ /* 13 cards in total. I will let querant know how many cards are in the deck so they don't wonder if the got them all. 

/*for images below, don't want them muddying up cards. And seems like a pain in ass to get all of this on img, esp since some photos have asian or arabic names in print/script. SHOULD I JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL CARDS IMGS FROM PNGTREE.COM? */

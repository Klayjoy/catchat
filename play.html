After deleted CONTENT class from NAV class area, I NOTICED THAT FOOTER WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE WAY I'D WANTED, but perhaps was already like that and didn't notice? When done with main part of site, see if footer might be better contained rather than fluid across, BUT IT BALANCES OUT NAV. PLUS FOOTER AND NAV MAY NEED TO BE PUNCHED UP WITH COLOR AND STYLE-->

Every week, I hand pick 16 different cards, that randomly appear when you click below. Once you get your action card, click again for another question. Once you have gotten your first action card, the cards randomly appear with each new click. Enjoy!!</p>

 <h1>About Cat Chat Tarot!</h1> 

 <div class="row p-2">
 <div class="col-12" id="intro"> 
 <p>Welcome to Cat Chat Tarot; a vehicle for my tarot readings. I have been doing tarot readings as a hobby for more than twenty years and have decided to take my readings public. I exclusively use a tarot deck called: Mystical Cats Tarot, which incorporates the traditional tarot deck with a cat twist. I was endeared to this deck, because the cats featured in the deck are based on actual cats.</p>

 <p>I really enjoy using this deck. If you are curious about Mystical Cats Tarot, you can check out their website <a href="http://www.mysticalcatstarot.com/index.html">here.</a> It's the only deck I use for divination these days. I have used the deck enough to incorporate my own card meanings.</p>

 <p> Although I do not publish my tarot readings online, I thought it would be fun to have a game where one can ask themselves a question, click on a button, and get an action card. You can find this game, on the <a href="play.html">Let's Play</a> page.</p>

<!-- WHEN duplicated above PARA to add more text, ALONG WITH PUTTING CONTENT CLASS IN NAVBAR, LOOKED BETTER, OTHERWISE IF CONTENT CLASS IN CONTAINER, UGLY THICK NAV BAR. But once I added padding to pic top/bottom and added one extra line of text, page looked great, whether CONTENT CLASS in nav or container. Just leave in CONTAINER. Although content, technically includes nav bar, I want that to always be proper size and not glitchy.  -->

<!--THE NAV BAR IS SQUISHED. 9/3 RIGHT BEFORE CLOSING OUT, HAD ON LARGE SCREEN, BUT A BIT SMALLER FRAME AND NAV SQUISHED ON TOP, EVEN WHEN SLIGHTLY SHRUNK PADDING ON TAROT CARDS IMG-->
 
 <p>If you would like to purchase a reading, I offer a variety of tarot readings styles, which can be purchased <a href ="purchase.html">here</a>. Thank you!</p>

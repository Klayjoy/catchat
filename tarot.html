       <p class="question"> Q: I am currently an interior designer, working under a large and very successful company. I have been wanting to venture out on my own, but fear the repurcussions of owning my own business. What if I run out of money and can't pay my mortgage? Or have clients who don't pay me for my work? The thought of having to deal with lawyers and being the main boss terrifys me. I don't want to lose my home or my mind! What do the cards see? -Cheryl D. </p>

<!--took out more button. This is not long enought to merit a read more, plus this column will balance out the tarot reveal card section next to it on tablet and PC size-->
       
      <div class="col answer">
        <p>Cheryl, you could easily lose your home if you get fired from your current job, so let's not CATastrophize the situation. Let's not focus on the money part, as the cards point to an issue that you have put on the back burner for quite some time.</p>
          
        <p>I see that you are quite organized in your life, but that you are still living in an 80's mindset. You choose not to be tech-savvy, which slows you down, whether at work or at home. How much more efficient would you be if you took a class on basic computer skills, and then upped it a notch every few months? Say, taking a class on photoshop or an indepth class on (grumbling) Windows 10? If you learn mundane, but usesful information in a more relaxed manner, your self-esteem will shoot up trememdously and you won't have to wait a month before your tech-savvy friend can help you or pay and arm and a leg for something that took 5 minutes to fix.</p>

         <p>The second issue I see has zero to do with you, and a lot to do with a divine storm...where a lot of 'bad' or annoying things come at you, at a most inconvenient time. This is actually a good thing. When so many things go wrong in a relatively short stretch of time, you can be sure that someone up there is setting you up for a more successful future. Because scrambling to get chores done, fix problems, and stay sane while dealing with unexpected visitors or say, losing your car, can really help your higher self kick into a more efficient mode of thinking.</p>
         
         <p>Perhaps your car breaking down leads to more money and better health. Less money to fork over on gas and other miscellaneous payments. Your health will improve from walking more.</p>
         
         <p>And as for your annoying new visitor, who's weekend stay turned into a month, that might help you to set bounderies with people in general, like that high-maintenance client who's always trying to squeeze more work from you,for free.</p>
         
        <p>The final card shows that now is not a good time to venture out on your own, but that's not to say that you can never have your own business. You can always do some prep work for the future, such as taking a business course, web design class, or even a class on interior design that is not your strong point.</p>
        
        <p>Good luck and remember that it is just as important to keep up on education as it is on making money. A little extra education may lead to a lot more money, while being able to happily stay at your current company, but in a much more satisfying role!

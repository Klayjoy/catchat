  <p>Thank you for visiting my website, Cat Chat Tarot. I hope that you enjoyed the free weekly reading as well as the random card generator in the play area.</p> 
  
  <p>I have been reading tarot cards for most of my adult life, and offer a variety of reading styles and prices. I prefer writting out my readings, as opposed to in person or via Skype. I have always prefered to take my time with a reading while alone in thought, and focus more on the psychology aspect rather than the fortune telling aspect. In fact, I hate anything to do with predictions, as I feel life is flexible and prefer a reading that provides insight into a question.</p> 
  
  <p>Below the frequently asked questions, you will find a list of reading types and prices. If you need further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">What type of payments do you take?</span> <br> At this point I only accept PayPal, but I am working on accepting other payments down the road.
  </li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">What kind of questions should I ask? What if I have a 2-part question. Is that extra money?</span>Depending on the reading that you purchase, it is one question per reading, but if the second question clarifies the main question I include it, as it gives the reading a more cohesive feel.</li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do I receive my reading via email or is it printed and mailed to me?</span></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">How long does it take to receive my reading?</span>I generally work on requests within two days of receiving them via email, and then I corespond with querent so as to clarify their question. It is very important to ask a simple and properly stated question. I also refuse to do anything that has a fortune telling or predictive element to it.</li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Do I get a discount if I purchase more than one reading?</span>I offer a 10% discount for the all the top-tier readings, with a price-point of $30 or more. The basic $15 dollar readings are not discounted.</li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Is my email address sold to marketers if I order a reading?</span>Absolutely not! Any communication we share for a reading is private and only kept in my files for my own records. For example, if I am having a special promotion, I am able to email you; or if you lose a reading, I can look it up and resend it. Please understand that after one year, I cannot guarantee that I will still have your reading on file.</li>
</ol>

<!-------------------playing to add better form that already has button disclaimer and has no sign in button, although I could probably get rid of that. Also checking out to see how price form looks, but won't be doing that--->












<!--------------------this ends new test form area of better form or form that has money-------------->



<!--I will not be using this form. I will do email and a check box that client/querent understands that this is only for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES-->

Klea Kostopoulos and Cat Chat Tarot are not liable for any monetary losses either. <br><br>THERE ARE NO REFUNDS on readings.

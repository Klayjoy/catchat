  <p>Thank you for visiting my website, Cat Chat Tarot. I hope that you enjoyed the free weekly reading as well as the random card generator in the play area.</p> 
  
  <p>I offer a variety of reading styles and prices. I prefer writting out my readings, as opposed to in person or via Skype. I have always prefered to take my time with a reading while alone in thought, and focus more on the psychology aspect rather than the fortune telling aspect. In fact, I hate anything to do with predictions, as I feel life is flexible and prefer a reading that provides insight into a question.</p> 
  
  <p>Below the frequently asked questions, you will find a list of reading types and prices. If you need further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.</p>

<!---had a price list group from bootstrap that seemed too complex/unnec for this, so simplifed to list-group and list-group-item. esp since seemed stupid to have a space to type in prices, when already listed. plus styling for bootstrap list seemed too complex. start simple----------------->  

<ul class="list-group p-2"> 

  <li class="list-group-item"><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:18px">Deluxe Reading:</span> Includes a 12 month spread and birthday month bonus <span style="font-weight:600">

  - $80</span></li> 

  <li class="list-group-item"><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:18px">Two-Question Combo:</span>Two questions, whether they are related to one issue or two completely different topics.<span style="font-weight:600">
  - $60</span></li>


  <li class="list-group-item"><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:18px">Celtic Cross Spread:</span>Traditional spread, which never goes out of style.<span style="font-weight:600">

<h2 class="p-1">FAQ</h2> 
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:17px">What type of payments do you take?</span> 
  <p> At this point I only accept PayPal, but I am working on accepting other payments down the road.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:17px">What if I have a 2-part question. Is that extra money?</span>
  <p> Depending on the reading that you purchase, it is one question per reading, but if the second question clarifies the main question I include it, as it gives the reading a more cohesive feel.</p></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:17px">Do I receive my reading via email or can I have it mailed to me?</span>
  <p>Either are fine. Just let me know.</p></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:17px">How long does it take to receive my reading?</span>
  <p>I generally work on requests within two days of receiving them via email, and then I corespond with querent so as to clarify their question. It is very important to ask a simple and properly stated question. I also refuse to do anything that has a fortune telling or predictive element to it.</p></li>
  
  <li><span style="font-weight:600; font-size:17px">Do I get a discount if I purchase more than one reading?</span>
  <p>I offer a 10% discount for readings, with a price-point of $60 or more.</p></li>
